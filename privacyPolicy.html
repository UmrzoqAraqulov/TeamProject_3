                    <p class="pi">Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are
                        unsure about how to get
                        the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to build a Figma
                        plugin
                        for the larger design community. The plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX
                        copies
                        cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone variation ranging from plain, casual to playful.
                        The
                        intention to build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog post, ‘Designing voice and
